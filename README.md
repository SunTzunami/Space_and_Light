# Space and Light: High School Comp-sci Project(2018)
High school computer science project (Used graphics library of C++ 3.0). I had to code this with Turbo C++ as CBSE (the examining body) made it mandatory to use that as the IDE.  

Most OOPs concepts like polymorphism, inheritance and encapsulation were utilised. Data file handling too was used.
I devised an interesting algorithm to award points via the quiz function - points are awarded based on swiftness in answering: quicker the user response, more points will be awarded provided that the user response is correct. 

# Coded three animations-

# 1.Dispersion of light-
Dispersion of a ray of white light by a prism.

# 2.Sunlight-

# 3.Red Giant-
5 billion years from now, the sun will become a red giant (will not happen in my lifetime and yet this phenomena scares the hell out of me).
